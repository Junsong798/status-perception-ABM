simulation0.R is the base version without yielding and extra costs for losers.

simulation0_failure_cost_yield.R is built upon simulation0.R with extra cost for losers and the option for yielding.

simulation0_partial_random.R further uses a continuous variable "random_cost_prop" to specify the proportion of cost that can be randomized.
